# Vanilla Improved
In this little Minecraft Mod experiment I want to try to learn new things and feature while having fun adding stuff into the game.
<br/><br/>
I also want to try and document my process and what I learn along the way both as a personal diary for the future me and for any new mod developer like me that want
to deep-dive in this amazing world.
